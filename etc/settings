# Settings for Duplicacy scripts
#

# NOTE: If this file exists during an upgrade, it will be left alone
# and the new version will be placed in settings-upgrade.

# If this is set, do an automatic update of the scripts by pulling
# the sources from GitHub and doing a 'make update'.
# CONFIG_AUTO_UPGRADE=yes

# If defined, limit bandwidth use to this value in megabits per
# second.  (This contrasts with Duplicacy's parameter, which is
# expressed in kilobytes per second.)
# CONFIG_BANDWIDTH=20

# If this is not set, skip doing storage maintenance.  Setting this is
# useful when multiple machines share the same storage and saves on
# download traffic if the storage is a paid service.
# CONFIG_NO_MAINT=yes
