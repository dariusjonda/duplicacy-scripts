List of things that need to be done:


Move prefs/cache to var and make symlink during installation

Make sure maintenance operations run quietly and failures produce
output for mailing.

Rearrange CONFIG_NO_MAINT to be CONFIG_MAINT.  (Makes more sense that
way.)

Make maintenance activities avoid backups running on the local host.
